Using decision tree algorithms, I predict which music genre individuals like based on age and gender.

The table music.csv contains the gender and age of several individuals, which is used to guess which music genre they prefer.

With decision trees, I will train the model on a training dataset and I will then predict which type of music new people like, using a test dataset. 
I assess the model accuracy and save the predictive model using joblib. I then visualize the decision tree with graphviz.
